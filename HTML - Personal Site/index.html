  <h2>Look
    Unsigned hype
    Front line aeronauts flurry
    Zero dark thirty
    Zero friends minotaur-fugly stepchild
    Evoke lunch jumped over plunging necklines
    Up, beside tongue-tied hungry enzymes
    Devote one into mothmen munching textiles
    Punisher
    Out past go-time
    Back 10 fried worms chubbier
    Brown grass both sides
    Canned food
    Manmade tools
    Lanacane, band aids, mandrake root
    Bindle on a broomstick, pancaked shoes
    And a handshake-proof campaign, can't lose
    Can't gain
    Smoke out moles like a force of nature
    Pray fortune return to his favor
    Swiftly
    Maybe in the form of a nest egg
    Maybe in the form of a tesla death ray
    Or a solid gold scene with something better to celebrate
    Than powder on a face like a flatfoot on jelly day
    M-m-moral compass all batshit
    Spinning in the shadows of immoral magnets
    Are we supporting the artist or enabling the addict
    I mean, I guess it matters to me
    I wish it mattered to you
    How a thousand virtues
    Kick the same bucket like chinatown turtles</h2>
